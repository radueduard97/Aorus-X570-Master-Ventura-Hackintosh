## What does work?

* IServices ( IMessages & Facetime )
* Bluetooth
* Wi-FI
* Hardware Acceleration
* Both ethernet adapters are working
* Sound 
* Almost everything â€¦.

## What does not work?

* Sidecar

## Important notes

* I do not recommend using this specific EFI, you should always build one yourself for your specific components.
* If you plan to grab this, make sure you fill in the Platform Info section in the `config.plist` file.
* I do not recommend trying to boot Sonoma with this one as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth won't work even if you do have a Fenvi card in your PC.
* You can make Wi-FI work in Sonoma using `Airportltlwm.kext`. I haven't managed tough to get the integrated bluetooth working in Sonoma, you could get a cheat ASUS BT400 card and it should work.
